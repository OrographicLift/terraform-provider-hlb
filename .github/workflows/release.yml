# This GitHub action can publish assets for release when a tag is created.
# Currently its setup to run on any tag that matches the pattern "v*" (ie. v0.1.0).
#
# This uses crazy-max/ghaction-import-gpg to import the GPG key from the 
# `ZONEHERO_RELEASES_KEY` secret for signing releases.
#
# You will need to pass the `--batch` flag to `gpg` in your signing step 
# in `goreleaser` to indicate this is being used in a non-interactive mode.
